# Third-Party Asset Registry

Runtime image assets are currently authored in-house and vendored locally under `/Users/m/Desktop/berries/public/assets/`.

## Current Status
- No third-party image assets are referenced by the active runtime catalog entries.
- If external image sources are introduced later, add one row per asset with library, license, source URL, and local output path.
