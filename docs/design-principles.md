# Design Principles

## Visual Direction
- 16-bit inspired arcade visuals.
- High-contrast palette with readable foreground text.
- Strong object silhouettes for quick recognition.

## Interaction Rules
- Mobile-first touch interactions.
- Minimum 44x44 px actionable targets.
- One primary call-to-action per panel/screen.

## Typography and Copy
- Short labels suitable for early readers.
- Visual cues (icons, pills, tags) used before long text.
- Layout supports longer Spanish strings without clipping.

## Game Card System
- Every card includes icon, status, title, description, age tags, skill tags, CTA.
- Status color coding is consistent across launcher pages.

## Accessibility Baseline
- Semantic labels for controls.
- Visible keyboard focus behavior.
- Avoid conveying state with color alone.

## Sound and Feedback
- Global mute is always available.
- SFX support actions and outcomes, but game remains playable muted.
